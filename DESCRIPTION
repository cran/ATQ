Description: Provides tools for evaluating timely epidemic detection models within school absenteeism-based surveillance systems. Introduces the concept of alert time quality as an evaluation metric. Includes functions to simulate populations, epidemics, and alert metrics associated with epidemic spread using population census data. The methods are based on research published in Vanderkruk et al. (2023) <doi:10.1186/s12889-023-15747-z> and Ward et al. (2019) <doi:10.1186/s12889-019-7521-7>.
